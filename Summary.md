Project Name: Park Place

Summary:

Park Place - A web app for the outdoors. 

These days, people are spending more and more time indoors. Whether we’re watching TV, gaming, or just browsing the internet, we’ve given up fresh air and natural light for a more exciting, artificial view of the world. Ironically, it is while using these same computers that we are told our actions could be detrimental to our physical and social health. It can be hard to resist the lure of stimulating gameplay and cute cat videos, but what if you had some help? Park Place keeps you connected with your favourite outdoor parks, and makes it easy for you to have a great time outside!

Locating the perfect park for you to get some fresh air is really convenient with our app Park Place. Users can find parks all over Vancouver by clicking on an interactive map, and by using our handy filters in the table view. You can filter parks by neighbourhood to find parks close to home, and we’ve added filters such as “dog off leash”, “playfield”, and “waterpark”, so that you can find a park suited perfectly for your needs. Furthermore, once you go to a park, you can rate it out of five stars so you can remember how much you liked it! If you’re looking for a new park to check out, you can see other user’s ratings as an average out of five stars, in order to determine if it’s a park worth going to. Once you’ve found the park of your dreams, you can click a small heart icon to indicate it as your favourite – and you can “favourite” more than one park. Finally, if you want everyone else to see how much fun you’re having at the park, you can click a button next to the park name to share it on Facebook. When your friends see how much fun you’re having in the park, they’ll want to join you too!
